- [ ] I've run the tests with `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- [ ] None of the tests were found failing
- [ ] I've seen the coverage report at `build/coverage/index.html`
- [ ] Not a single line left uncovered by tests
- [ ] Any coding standards issues were fixed with `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix`
- [ ] Hotfix-type commits were squashed with `git rebase -i` or `git commit --amend`
- [ ] All my work wasn't smushed into one large commit without necessity
